# OpenData-analysis
This repository contains an analysis of the OpenData 13TeV dataset released by ATLAS.  
For now the main focus is to look at dilepton final states, and compare MC cycles and data in search for the graviton.

Both productions of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=G\rightarrow ee"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=G\rightarrow \mu\mu"> is studied for gravitons in the mass range 750GeV-4000GeV.

NB: Be aware of the lep_type in datasetIDs for signal samples! 3055(50, 53, 56, 59, 62) may not contain correct lep_type.
