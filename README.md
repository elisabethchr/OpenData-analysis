# OpenData-analysis
This repository contains an analysis of the OpenData 13TeV dataset released by ATLAS.  
For now the main focus is to look at dilepton final states, and compare MC cycles and data in search for the graviton.

Both productions of $'G\rightarrow ee'$ and G->mumu is studied for a graviton mass of 750GeV. $`\sqrt{2}`$
